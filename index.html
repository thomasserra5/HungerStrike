        <center><h1>Hunger Strike</h1></center>
        <div id="border"><div id="paragraph">

            <h2>Why I am doing this</h2>
            <p>I see no advancement in the fight against AI in Maryland– specifically data centers. It is clear to me that my representatives feel very comfortable letting AI into Maryland despite how it will kill us. So what will I do and what are my goals?</p>

            <h2>What I am doing</h2>
            <p>I will go on hunger strike with a goal of publicity. The plan is to go on hunger strike and sleep outside of the Maryland General assembly building in Annapolis. I will also be posting multiple videos on my personal Instagram discussing the strike and my demands.The goal of publicity is to use the upcoming midterms. If Wes Moore and our US House members want to be taken seriously this election cycle, they will need to fight for us.</p>
            <h2>Topics</h2>
            <p>ICE and AI are intertwined, so part of fighting ICE is fighting AI. ICE collaborates with companies like Flock, Persona Identities, and Palantir household names to stalk us. A large part of my hunger strike is to bring awareness to AI companies like Flock and Persona. I want to highlight the dangers of becoming a surveillance state. AI databases that track our movement and location are dangerous. More importantly these tools are already being used to kidnap people. Below are statistics and headlines that I will use.</p>
            <p id="bullet">- A mid-sized data center can consume the same amount of water a day as 1,000 households. (Copley)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- Data centers in the US alone are predicted to cause a total of 1,300 premature deaths by 2030. (Biology Insights)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- Noise pollution from data centers disrupts sleep cycles and stress. (Biology Insights)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- Noise pollution from data centers can cause dizziness and discomfort even at frequencies humans can’t hear, called “infrasound”. (Jordan)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- By 2030, data centers in the US could contribute to 600,000 asthma cases. This would account for more than a third of all asthma-related deaths in the country. (Sinha)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- It is estimated that by 2030, data centers will create a national public health cost that could exceed $20 billion. (Sinha)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- Flock cameras disproportionately surveil Black and high-poverty neighborhoods. (Cox)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- Flock cameras and AI databases are used by ICE. (Stanley)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- Flock cameras can track the make, model, color, distinguishing characteristics, and bumper stickers of a car. (Stanley)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- For an unknown period, at least 60 AI-powered surveillance cameras manufactured by Flock Safety were accessible to anyone on the internet. No password required. No login needed. Just a web browser and the camera’s IP address. (Dooley)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- Every selfie or ID you upload to ChatGPT, Roblox, LinkedIn, and many other sites for verification is handled by a San Francisco firm called Persona. A massive leak has exposed its other side – a platform capable of feeding the US government with 269 sophisticated surveillance checks on millions of users worldwide. (Corvin)</p>
            <p id="bullet">- ICE established a contract with social media scanning companies that conduct “automated, continuous and targeted collection of multimedia data” from all major “news streams, search engines, social media, marketplaces, the dark web, etc.” (Quintin)</p>

            <h2>*UNLESS</h2><p>All of these predictions and surveillance technologies will harm us unless we do something. This protest is not meant to spark hopelessness or even catharsis– the message should inspire people. The truth is fascism will never win. It is unsustainable. It is built by the greediest, laziest people, and every attempt they make to oppress us will only make us fight back stronger.</p>

            <h2>What I need</h2><p>I need support. While I’m not necessarily asking anyone to go on hunger strike with me, I am asking for help. I need publicity. I need people to talk about what is happening. Even if my strike only lasts 24 hours and no politician acknowledges me– the louder we are, the more apparent their silence becomes. I need people to know that there are ways we can fight against ICE. This means banning surveillance technology. This means stopping data centers. This means prosecuting companies and individuals who violate our privacy.</p>

            <h2>Logistics</h2><p>I will need a steady supply of water and hopefully tea(no sugar). It will be cold, and possibly rainy. The Maryland General Assembly building has a roof over the front entrance which will hopefully help with the rain. I have access to high quality sleeping bags for the cold. I will most likely use the bathroom in nearby public spaces. I will have my phone with me. Ideally I will have help creating and posting videos. I plan on posting one video announcing my strike, a video at the start of my strike, and at least 2 videos with additional information on why AI data centers need to be stopped. These videos will ideally be scripted beforehand. If I make it past 48 hours I will need help monitoring my health.</p>
